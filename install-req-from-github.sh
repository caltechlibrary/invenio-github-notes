# Start by installing a closure set of all invenio modules needed.  I created
# this list iteratively, by installing invenio modules with normal pip
# dependency resolution turned on, one at a time, and watching for additional
# invenio modules that got installed, then adding them to the list below.
#
# The principle here is to install the latest versions from Github repos
# because I discovered that what invenio modules you get from PyPI are in
# some cases broken and unusuable.  The versions in the repos may also have
# many commits after the PyPI-released versions.
#
# Note that in this step, we have to be careful NOT to allow pip's automatic
# dependency resolution at this stage, because otherwise, pip will happily
# load dependent Invenio modules from PyPI, defeating the goal here.

# it's okay to let pip install them from PyPI.  But, we have to take note of

# missed during the round of installations above because we turned off
# dependency resolution. We will install the missing items separately below.

# some reason, this round of installations still results in a few more
# missing dependencies being reported.

# But first, special cases: invenio-previewer and invenio-cli needs old
# versions of some python packages, and we have to install them explicitly
# before we let pip's automatic resolution grab newer versions. So:
